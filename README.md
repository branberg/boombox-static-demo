# Boombox Demo (static)
A static version of the [Boombox Wordpress theme](https://github.com/branberg/Boombox-WP) for demo purposes.

This repo doesn't really have any useful stuff in it. The source code was simply ripped from a demo installation of the theme to give a preview of what the theme looks like.

If you are interested in using Boombox, please [download the most recent release here](https://github.com/branberg/Boombox-WP/releases/latest) and go that route.

Thanks, and enjoy!
